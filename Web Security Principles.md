# Web Security 

1. Security is defined as the state of being protected or safe from harm.

2. Web Security means keeping your web server, and it's applications protected or safe from harm. Websites require special attention. They're public, high-profile and often represent brand of the company and in some cases like Amazon, the company itself.

3. In order to protect the websites from security issues, we need to understand the potential pitfalls and threats that the application might encounter.

4. We need to know who would attack us and how would they do it. Once we've surveyed the potential problems, we need to come up with required measures to ensure safety of information. Awareness + Protection = Security.

# General Security Principles

# Least Privilege

1. The principle of least privilege says that every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job.

2. The principle of least privilege means giving a user account only those privileges which are essential to that user's work and nothing more. 

3. And a user with limited privileges, certainly, shouldn't be able to edit their own user privileges. Code has access privileges too. Code should be limited in what it exposes and what it accesses. 

4. The benefits of the principle of least privilege are that you'll have more code stability, because you'll be able to control the access to data. 

5. It'll make it easier to test actions and interactions between different parts of your code. It will also increase your system security because any vulnerabilities that you have are going to be limited and localized. 

6. For example, if a low-level user has their password compromised, you don't have to worry that the entire system is compromised. Only the areas to which that user had access are a concern. What could be a nightmare scenario suddenly becomes a small problem that can be solved quickly.
